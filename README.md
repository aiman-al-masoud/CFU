Classroom Finder Utility


        an android utility meant
        to parse time tables,
        for the purpose of
        extracting valuable information
        on weekly classroom/course
        availability.

        The app can download and
        parse html tables from
        a user-editable homepage.
        Alternatively, the
        user can make their own
        time-table(s), by editing
        a text file.

        This is anexperimental
        product, no warranties
        of any kind are offered
        on its functioning.
        I don\'t take any
        responsibility
        for any moral or material
        damage possibly caused
        by its usage.

        The code is freely
        available on GitHub.
        Please make good use of it,
        and if you plan
        on forking the project,
        make it open-source
        AND freely modifiable
        AND freely redistributable.
